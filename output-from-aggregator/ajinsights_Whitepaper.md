# AJ Insights: Technical and Business Whitepaper

## 1. Executive Summary

AJ Insights is an integrated Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform designed to democratize enterprise-grade digital tooling and data analytics for micro and small businesses. The platform addresses a critical technology gap faced by local service providers, particularly tradies, by offering a single, affordable subscription that bundles website creation, Customer Relationship Management (CRM), automated data integration, and AI-powered insights.

The core value proposition of AJ Insights is to empower small business owners to make data-driven decisions, automate manual processes, and achieve a significant return on investment, targeting a 10-20x return on a $100/month subscription. The project was also conceived as a practical sandbox for exploring advanced Large-Language-Model (LLM) capabilities and agentic workflows, including GPT-driven content generation, predictive pricing agents, and autonomous diagnostic bots.

Technically, the platform has evolved from a V1 client-server model leveraging SuiteCRM to a sophisticated V2 architecture. The V2 platform is a modern, full-stack TypeScript application featuring a React/Next.js frontend, a Node.js/Express backend, and a PostgreSQL database. It incorporates a microservices architecture orchestrated with Kubernetes, a comprehensive data ecosystem with a data lake (AWS S3) and data warehouse (Snowflake), and an event streaming pipeline using Apache Kafka. The platform is designed for scalability, security, and continuous integration and deployment through a modern DevOps infrastructure.

The business is currently seeking a $100k seed investment to fund six months of full-time development to achieve product-market fit, engage early adopters, and scale to paying customers, with a go/no-go decision milestone at the end of this period.

## 2. Business Foundation

### Company Background & Mission

AJ Insights was founded as an aspirational venture with the mission to "level the playing field for small businesses." The founder, leveraging a background in enterprise analytics, machine learning, and business reporting for large corporations, identified a significant disparity in the digital tools available to small versus large businesses.
