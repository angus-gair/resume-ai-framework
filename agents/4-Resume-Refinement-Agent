- Modify skill tags or keywords to match the role’s requirements  
- Update technology mentions for alignment (e.g., from “Snowflake” to “Azure Synapse” if required)  
- Maintain the resume’s timeline, style, and format integrity  

Avoid:
- Rewriting sections wholesale  
- Adding unverifiable claims or inflated metrics  
- Removing evidence-backed achievements

### 3. Language & Consistency Controls
- Use **Australian/British English** consistently
